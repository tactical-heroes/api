# Tactical Heroes API

Backend API service for Tactical Heroes.

## Stack

- .NET 10
- ASP.NET Core
- PostgreSQL
- EF Core migrator
- Docker
- Helm
- GitHub Actions

## Local Development

Restore packages:

```bash
dotnet restore PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.slnx
```

Format code, or check formatting without changing files:

```bash
dotnet format --severity warn --no-restore
dotnet format --verify-no-changes --severity warn --no-restore
```

Architecture tests check member ordering in authored `src`, `tests`, and `tools` code:
constants, fields, constructors, finalizers, events, properties, indexers, methods,
operators, nested types. Within each group, accessibility comes first
(`public`, `internal`, `protected internal`, `protected`, `private protected`, `private`),
then static before instance members, then readonly before mutable fields.
Members with equal ordering keys retain their logical order; no alphabetical sort
is required. Partial declarations are checked separately. Explicit interface
implementations are grouped with public members.

This convention runs with the architecture tests, independently of `dotnet format`:

```bash
dotnet test --project tests/PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.ArchitectureTests/PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.ArchitectureTests.csproj
```

When reordering initialized fields or properties, preserve their initialization
dependencies; move dependent initialization into the appropriate constructor if needed.

Build the solution:

```bash
dotnet build PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.slnx --configuration Release
```

Run tests:

```bash
dotnet test --solution PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.slnx --configuration Release
```

Identity and Compendium integration and functional tests run sequentially within
each assembly (`ParallelMode.None`). CI still runs separate test projects in
parallel. Database resets clear only the module schema and preserve migration
history and Wolverine's messaging tables, which remain in use by background workers.

Run the API:

```bash
dotnet run --project src/PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.Host/PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.Host.csproj
```

In the `Development` environment, open `/scalar` to explore the Identity and
Compendium APIs. For protected endpoints, enter an access token in the Bearer
authentication field without the `Bearer` prefix; Scalar adds the authorization
header automatically.

The host's `ScalarConfiguration:BearerAuthenticationSchemes` setting maps
`OpenIddict.Validation.AspNetCore` (protected API endpoints) and
`OpenIddict.Server.AspNetCore` (UserInfo) to Bearer authentication in OpenAPI.
This setting describes authentication in the documentation; endpoint access rules
remain unchanged.

Run the EF migrator:

```bash
dotnet run --project tools/PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.Ef.Migrator/PANiXiDA.TacticalHeroes.Ef.Migrator.csproj --configuration Release
```

## OpenIddict Certificates

Store separate signing/encryption certificates as Base64 PFX with passwords in OpenBao at
`secret/applications/tactical-heroes-api/<environment>` (`development` or `production`),
shared by that environment's API replicas:

```text
Identity__Provider__SigningCertificates__0__PfxBase64
Identity__Provider__SigningCertificates__0__Password
Identity__Provider__EncryptionCertificates__0__PfxBase64
Identity__Provider__EncryptionCertificates__0__Password
```

Never commit PFX data or passwords.

Configured certificates take precedence. Development certificates are a fallback only
when both lists are empty in Development, Test, or tooling without a host environment.
Other environments require both lists; partial or invalid configuration fails startup.

For rotation, add certificates at the next index and retain old ones until their tokens
expire. Refresh ExternalSecrets and restart pods after changes. The initial switch
may require users to sign in again.

## Repository Layout

- `src/` - application source code.
- `tests/` - unit, integration, functional, and architecture tests.
- `tools/` - service tooling, including the EF migrator.
- `deploy/helm/` - Helm deployment values.

## Initialization Notes

This repository was created from the PANiXiDA .NET backend template. Template
packaging files and repository-only examples have been removed. Project,
namespace, Helm, Docker, and CI names were initialized for Tactical Heroes API.
